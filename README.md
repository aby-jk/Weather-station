# Weather-station
The industrial environment
monitoring device is a system of low-cost offthe-
shelf sensors, programmed to
continuously monitor the environmental
conditions of small scale industrial
workspaces. The parameters measured
include temperature, humidity, altitude,
sound, light, carbon dioxide (ppm), and
carbon monoxide (% volume). The data is
continuously obtained and transmitted using
an autonomous Wi-Fi module to a cloud
storage. The logged data is then represented
by several graphs to ease the process of
analysis and highlight times at which hazards
are detected.
